        <h1> About the Project <h1>
        <h4> This project started with the aim of visualising Bitcoin's blockchain. However, in the process of development, I thought that it
            would be interesting to combine visualisation with gamification. Consequently, this is a an asteroid-like game but with the difference that
            the asteroids are created based on bitcoin transactions. The size of the asteroid reflects the amount of satoshis paid in the transaction.
            At this point only size is reflected in the game but there are plans for enhancements.
        </h4>
        <h1> Technologies <h1>
            <h4>In order to develop the game I used NodeJS, TypeScript, Phaser game engine and Bitcoin's blockchain socket API. I wanted to
                experiment with Typescript and I can easily admit that web app development with TypeScript feels really great since I mostly
                have an object-oriented background. I definitely suggest to give it a try guys, you will love it.
